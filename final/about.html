            <p>Hi, I'm Shea</br >
              I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Montana who is minoring in Media Arts.
              My coursework in Computer Science has provided me with training in Python, Java, C++, HTML, and CSS.
              I also have experience with graphic design and film editing. Outside of school, I work as a Help Desk Technictian
              for The University of Montana's online learning management system. I also work for different departments across
              campus as a web designer using Cascade. I am currently a Junior and plan to graduate in May of 2023.</p>

          <p>When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy painting, reading, playing video games, and spending time with my fiance and three pets.
            I was born in Billings, MT and moved to Missoula for college. I spend my highschool years working as a Certified Nursing Assistant but later found that I had a passion for programming and web design.
            After I graduate I plan to move to Oregon and pursue a career in Web Development.</p>
