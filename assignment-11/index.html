    <h1>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</h1>

      Old Henry Lee stood transfixed by all the commotion at the Panama Hotel. What had started as a crowd of
      curious onlookers eyeballing a television news crew had now swollen into a polite mob of shoppers, tourists,
      and a few punk-looking street kids, all wondering what the big deal was. In the middle of the crowd stood Henry,
      shopping bags hanging at his side. He felt as if he were waking from a long forgotten dream. A dream he’d once had as a little boy.
    </p></div>

      The old Seattle landmark was a place he’d visited twice in his lifetime. First when he was only twelve years old,
      way back in 1942—“the war years” he liked to call them. Even then the old bachelor hotel had stood as a gateway
      between Seattle’s Chinatown and Nihonmachi, Japantown. Two outposts of an old-world conflict—where Chinese and
      Japanese immigrants rarely spoke to one another, while their American-born children often played kick the can
      in the streets together. The hotel had always been a perfect landmark. A perfect meeting place—where he’d once
      met the love of his life.
    </p></div>

      The second time was today. It was 1986, what, forty-plus years later? He’d stopped counting the years as they
      slipped into memory. After all, he’d spent a lifetime between these bookended visits. A marriage. The birth
      of an ungrateful son. Cancer, and a burial. He missed his wife, Ethel. She’d been gone six months now. But
      he didn’t miss her as much as you’d think, as bad as that might sound. It was more like quiet relief really.
      Her health had been bad—no, worse than bad. The cancer in her bones had been downright crippling, to both of us, he thought.
    </p></div>
    <div><p>
      For the last seven years Henry had fed her, bathed her, helped her to the bathroom when she needed to go, and
      back again when she was all through. He took care of her night and day, 24/7 as they say these days. Marty,
      his son, thought his mother should have been put in a home, but Henry would have none of it. “Not in my lifetime,”
      Henry said, resisting. Not just because he was Chinese (though that was a part of his resistance). The Confucian
      ideal of filial piety—respect and reverence for one’s parents—was a cultural relic not easily discarded by Henry’s
      generation. He’d been raised to care for loved ones, personally, and to put someone in a home was unacceptable.
      What his son, Marty, never fully understood was that deep down there was an Ethel-shaped hole in Henry’s life, and
      without her, all he felt was the draft of loneliness, cold and sharp, the years slipping away like blood from a wound that never heals.
    </p></div>

      Now she was gone for good. She needed to be buried, Henry thought, the traditional Chinese way, with food offerings,
      longevity blankets, and prayer ceremonies lasting several days—despite Marty’s fit about cremating her. He was so modern.
      He’d been seeing a counselor and dealing with his mother’s death through an online support group, whatever that was.
      Going online sounded like talking to no one, which Henry had some firsthand experience in—in real life. It was lonely.
      Almost as lonely as Lake View Cemetery, where he’d buried Ethel. She now had a gorgeous view of Lake Washington, and
      was interred with Seattle’s other Chinese notables, like Bruce Lee and his own son, Brandon. But in the end, each of
      them occupied a solitary grave. Alone forever. It didn’t matter who your neighbors were. They didn’t talk back.
