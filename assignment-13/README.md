1. My imaginary client was a tattoo shop called Black Lotus Tattoos. They wanted blacks and reds on their site and wanted to share the history of the shop and allow clients to contact them and look at the artists.
2. It is important to consider a mobile first design because so much of the population is accessing content on mobile devices. Search engines also prefer mobile-friendly sites.
3. It took me a while to come up with an idea for the site and what I wanted on each page. Overall everything went well though.
