      <p>"My name is James.
        <br /><br />Yes, I'm a dude.
        <br /><br />I’m also the New York Times bestselling author of Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet—which was, in no particular order,
        an IndieBound NEXT List Selection, a Borders Original Voices Selection, a Barnes & Noble Book Club Selection, Pennie’s Pick at Costco,
        a Target Bookmarked Club Pick, and a National Bestseller. It was also named the #1 Book Club Pick for Fall 2009/Winter 2010 by the
        American Booksellers Association.
        <br /><br />In addition, Hotel has been translated into 35 languages. I’m still holding out for Klingon (that’s when you know you’ve made it).
        <br /><br />My second novel, Songs of Willow Frost was published September 2013.
        <br /><br />My latest novel, Love and Other Consolation Prizes, will be published September 12, 2017.
        <br /><br />On the personal side, I'm the proud father of more teenagers than I can keep track of. Yep, it's chaos, but the good kind of chaos."
        <br /><br />- Jamie Ford</p>
