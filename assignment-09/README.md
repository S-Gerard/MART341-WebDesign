1. I have learned HTML in the past but it was many years ago and it was pretty basic. Some things that have been new is the forms and tables. It has been interesting to re-learn this and I'm excited to continue to learn more about design.
2. I am excited to start learning about external stylesheets and begin focusing on the design aspect of our websites.
3. I struggled with styling the pages the way I wanted but after doing some research I was able to figure it out.
