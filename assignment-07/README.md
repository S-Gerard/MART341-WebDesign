I commonly come across forms that allow you to subscribe to newsletters and mailing lists. I also come across contact forms which allow you to send a message to business from their website.

An example of a text input would be an area for you to input your email or name. A selection input could allow you to select the state you live in or something else that has a lot of options to choose from. An example of a button input would be a yes or no option asking if you wanting to receive marketing offers when subscribing to newsletters.

I think I struggled a bit with understanding the tables and how to structure my content to get it to display the way I wanted. After looking through some of the resources on the website and looking at your example I was able to figure it out.
