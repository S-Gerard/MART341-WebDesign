1. divs can be used to create a block of code and add structure to your code. Classes and Ids are used to identify different elements which is useful to give them different styles. Spans are similar to divs but are used inline to block off text that needs to be unique.
2. Using third party hosting services takes up less storage on your website and lets your website run faster however you don't have control if the website fails and third party services can be costly.
3. I was having trouble with the YouTube video. I know the video is available and I am using the embedded code however it says the video is unavailable. I did some research and found that copyrighted videos won't play when embedded. I wasn't able to find a workaround but I added a hyperlink to the video as well.
