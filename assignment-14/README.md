1. I chose to use Bootstrap.
2. I used a CDN because it seemed like less steps than downloading the files.
3. HTML5 brings new elements that allow us to build more powerful websites. How does HTML5 change the web?
4. I struggled a bit with understanding how to use the libraries but I was able to figure out Bootstrap because of some resources online. I had that issue with my canvas that you helped me figure out.
