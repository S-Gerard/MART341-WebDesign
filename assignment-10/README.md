1. The Universal selector is used to stylize all the elements on the page. You might use this for something like font-family if you want all text on the page to be the same style. Element selectors affect all of the same type of elements. You could use this if you wanted all paragraphs to be the same font size or color. Class selectors can be used to group different elements that should have the same style. For example, you might want and header and a paragraph to have the same background color in order to group them together. The id selector specifies one element. You might want one header to be a different color than all the others so you can give it a unique id to style it differently.
2. I chose my color's based on a 1970s graphic. They are, #FBEFE1, #F9A366, #E15C30, #F6D6D2.
3. It took me awhile to figure out what I wanted to do for my website and what colors I wanted to choose but otherwise I think I was successful this week. I had fun on this page.
