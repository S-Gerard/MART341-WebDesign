    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>400 degrees F</strong>.</li>
        <li>Toss the cherry tomatoes and olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour into a 2 1/2 to 3-quart baking dish. Place the feta in the center of the tomatoes, then season with a pinch of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake until the tomatoes have burst and the feta has softened, about <strong>30 minutes.</strong></li>
        <li>Increase the heat to <strong>450 degrees F</strong>, then continue to cook until the tomatoes and feta are golden brown, <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong> more.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about <strong>13 minutes.</strong></li>
        <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water, then drain well.</li>
        <li>Right as the tomatoes and feta come out of the oven, stir in the garlic.</li>
        <li>Use the back of a spoon to smash the tomatoes and feta into a smooth and creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss in the pasta and half of the basil until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Add some pasta water, a couple tablespoons at a time, if the sauce becomes too thick.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Top with the remaining basil and a pinch of flaky sea salt for serving.</li>
      </ol>
